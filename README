## Introduction

[Colemak](http://colemak.com/) is an ergonomic keyboard layout optimized for efficient typing in English. It works fine for most European languages (actually, anything is better than QWERTY). Czech would be one of them, but it uses diacritic marks very frequently (especially acute and caron), hence default Colemak 3rd/4th layer mappings are rather inconvenient. Therefore, Czech mutation of Colemak was developed.

Most frequent diacritic marks and typographic symbols were placed logically --- to make the layout easy to learn. The gaps will be filled with other diacritic marks and other useful symbols, which are essential for writing expressions/names in common European languages.
